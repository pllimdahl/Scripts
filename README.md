To use the  script:

Open a text editor and paste the above code.
Save the file with a .sh extension, for example, screenshot_script.sh.
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the command bash screenshot_script.sh.
Enter the duration in minutes for which you want to take screenshots.
Enter the time to start the script in the format HH:MM.
The script will wait until the specified start time and then start taking screenshots at regular intervals for the specified duration.
After the duration ends, the script will save the screenshots in a zip file with a unique name.
The zip file will contain all the captured screenshots.
Note: This script still assumes that you have the scrot command installed on your system and the zip command installed to create the zip file.
